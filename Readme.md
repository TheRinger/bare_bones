<h1>Bare Bones</h1>

<p>This is a bare bones template to help get your project up and running.</p>

<p>This was built because I was frustrated to setup a new landing template
everytime I want to start a new/fun side project.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you in the future.</p>


<h2>What this template does</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Single page</li>
  <li>Mobile and Full Web responsive</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tech Info</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>[bootstrap.min.css](http://getbootstrap.com/css/)  bootstrap.css</li>
  <li>[bootstrap.min.js](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/)  bootstrap.js</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reason behind some tech</h3>
<p>Difference between bootstrap.min and css or js. There is no difference in
functionality but the file size is smaller by reducing blank spaces, comments,
and lines. You can delete one of them if you would like.</p>
